# CBI Project
When I started grad school I was brought onto a life cycle assessment project for biomass energy utilization in California. 
Information about the project can be found [here](http://www.schatzlab.org/news/2017/10/california-biopower-impact-project-creating-a-life-cycle-assessment-for-bioenergy-systems/) and on a website that I created, [here](http://cbi.max-gis.com).

This will be a repo for finished R scripts relating to my work on the project and for my thesis work.
